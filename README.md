Description of the Web App
======================
The project can be considered as part of office automation process for small to medium scale companies.

Business Case: Company ZZZ needs to print out a big pile of files and mail to customers. After signing some of pages, customers will return those signed pages by mail. Sometimes clients will mix some documents or put them in wrong order, therefore after received the returned package, ZZZ staffs have to check all pages again to make sure all signing pages have been returned, put them in the right order and archive them. This make take great amount of time.
